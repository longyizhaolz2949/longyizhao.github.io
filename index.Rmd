# Pet Friends
I have three close pet friends. The first one is a 5 years old cat called Jumy, he's my mom's cat.

This is my friend Sara's dog called Jingle, she got this name because she was born on the Christmas eve. She is 8 years old I think.

The other one is also a dog called Bagel, he is my friend Lucia's dog. Sara and Lucia are sisters, so Jingle and Bagel live together sometimes.
